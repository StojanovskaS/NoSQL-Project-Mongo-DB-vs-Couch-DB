# NoSQL-Project-Mongo-DB-vs-Couch-DB

The downside of relational databases is that there is a so-called ACID concept, which carries its limitations in terms of speed and scaling when it comes to working with large amounts of data. The rise of unstructured databases was a data stimulus for research of one of those types, document-based databases. This type of database focuses on the storage and access methods optimized for working with documents versus queues or records as we are used to in relational database management systems.
### The research focuses on two separate databases of this type, MongoDB and CouchDB. The aim was to make a comparative analysis of these two databases by testing the same questionnaires on the same data set.
